      "Based on Mary's credit report, her credit risk can be assessed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Credit Score:** Mary's credit score is 650, which is classified as \"B\" by the credit reporting agency. This indicates that she has some credit history, but it is not as strong as it could be.\n",
      "2. **Credit History:** Mary has a mix of different credit types, including installment loans, revolving credit, and a mortgage. However, she has a high debt-to-income ratio, which could be a concern.\n",
      "3. **Payment History:** Mary has a history of late payments, including a 30-day late payment on a revolving account. This could negatively impact her credit score.\n",
      "4. **Public Records:** Mary has a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, which will remain on her credit report for up to 10 years. This is a significant negative mark on her credit report.\n",
      "5. **Collections:** Mary has two collection accounts, which will also remain on her credit report for up to 7 years. These accounts are currently unpaid.\n",
      "6. **Credit Utilization:** Mary's credit utilization ratio is high, with some accounts showing balances that are close to or exceed the credit limits.\n",
      "7. **Inquiries:** Mary has had multiple inquiries into her credit history, which could negatively impact her credit score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Mary's credit risk is considered moderate to high. She has some positive credit history, but it is outweighed by the negative marks on her credit report, including the bankruptcy filing and multiple late payments. To improve her credit risk, Mary should focus on:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Making all payments on time\n",
      "* Reducing her debt-to-income ratio\n",
      "* Paying down high-balance accounts\n",
      "* Avoiding new inquiries into her credit history\n",
      "* Monitoring her credit report for errors and disputing any inaccuracies.\n",
      "\n",
      "By taking these steps, Mary can work to improve her credit risk and increase her chances of being approved for credit in the future.\n"
